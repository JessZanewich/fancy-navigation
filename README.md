# fancy-navigation
If you would like to see the code in action, I have a [Code Sandbox](https://llexl.csb.app/) that is using my API keys.

I have removed my keys from this repository, and my key is only active on the Code Sandbox, restricted to the specified domain. You must generate your own keys to have the Github code work for you. If you see an error message, your keys are not working properly. 

This is a simple navigation bar that loads a list of cities, and has a floating indicator bar to show the current selection. On resize of window, it recalculates the position to continue to show the current selection.
When a city is selected, it will show the current time in that location!
