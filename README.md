# fancy-navigation
If you would like to see the code in action, I have a [Code Sandbox](https://llexl.csb.app/) that is using my API keys.

The keys for the api are only activated for the specified Code Sandbox link. They have been heavily restricted. You must substitute `YOUR_OWN_KEY_HERE` with your own Google Maps API key. If you see an error message displayed in the blue box, your keys are not working properly. 

This is a simple navigation bar that loads a list of cities, and has a floating indicator bar to show the current selection. On resize of window, it recalculates the position to continue to show the current selection.
When a city is selected, it will show the current time in that location!
